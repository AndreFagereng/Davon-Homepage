  <!-- Below is a little unorthodox code to make a menu-icon for the mobile-version. The reason behind
  this is to avoid using JavaScript. The method gives us a little lower score on checker-site, but this was the method
  that gave us most accessibilty on all platforms. This method includes the checkbox, page-wrap and sidebartoggler-->

                    <p>Davon is a startup tech company based in Oslo, Norway. As the internet is ever expanding and moving into almost every aspect of society, we believe that everyone should have access, regardless of income or other circumstances. The internet is an invaluable tool, creating connections and making daily life easier and more manageable.

                    <div class="sectionAbout">
                        <p>With globalization and the huge technological advancement that has happened the past decades, access to the internet has become a necessity across the world. Even in areas where electricity and internet is considered a luxury. In those areas, there are other ways of connecting and reaching out to people such as TV, newspapers or perhaps even radio. However, access to these is also limited and it also carries a treat of censorship in certain areas.
                        </p>

                    <div class="sectionAbout">
                        <p>Cellular services such as voice calls and text messages exist, but the limited connectivity and lower quality of service make it a less than perfect solution. The Internet is thus far the best solution, not only communication wise, but also in terms of accessibility and possibilities on a larger scale. The drawback has traditionally been the need for copper cables and expensive maintenance, but with STARnet, this too will change.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="sectionAbout">
                        <p>With the internet's entry to the daily lives of billions of people across the globe, traditional institutions and services such as banking, medicine, weather forecasting and more, has changed dramatically in how they operate. As they have had to invest billions in order to remain relevant and competitive to the costumer, the competition of being the best out there has been beneficial for the consumer. No more queuing, greater customer support, reduced cost for the end user, greater access – empowering the user.

                    <p>So, considering all the benefits the internet has to offer, how can we provide access to areas where it is considered impossible or too costly to add wired lines? Compared to conventional power- and internet companies, Davon doesn’t have any impact on the environment, wildlife or existing infrastructure. You replace your roof with a solution that pays for itself over time, add an intelligent power storage on your wall, and you’re online. Zero power lines, zero digging, and zero harmful elements.
