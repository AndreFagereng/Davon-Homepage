      this is to avoid using JavaScript. The method gives us a little lower score on checker-site, but this was the method
      that gave us most accessibilty on all platforms. This method includes the checkbox, page-wrap and sidebartoggler-->

                      value for the brand while making research and development easier. In turn the technology behind it becomes cheaper and
                      more efficient.

                <p>Davon's final goal is internet access for everyone in a simple, easy-to-use, and economically viable
                  solution independent to weather conditions. We focus particularly on residents in rural or remote
                  areas without the necessary infrastructure for cabled access. Whether you live in the desert or the
                  tundra, if there's weather, there's STARnet!
