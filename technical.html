                      As of now, a satellite dish mostly serves as a necessary evil because other alternatives are either too expensive to install, or simply impossible due to lack of infrastructure in your area. Regardless of whether you’re connected to a power grid, or have access to cabled internet, Davon has the solution for you. Davon's STARnet technology aims to put an end to the dish, and improve the key features that made it great. Our antenna technology is integrated into the tiles of Tesla's Solar Roof. Instead of one vulnerable antenna, we have a myriad of well protected antennas working together in an array. If one tile breaks, it doesn't have an impact on your connectivity, or your power production. If you're the owner of a Tesla Powerwall, STARnet uses just a fraction of the household's overall consumption.

Above the earth is a large Davon satellite sending and receiving information from both houses through a visible lazer beam. Another beam goes back and forth from the industrial building.

                    <h2 id="tittel2">How does satellite internet work?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-top:7%;">Rather than cable internet or telephone lines, satellite Internet uses geostationary orbit satellites (GEO). Geostationary means that the satellites are orbiting the globe in a fixed position relative to a specific point on earth. The satellites match the earth's rotation velocity, which provides a steady signal line to a given area. Since the satellite stays put at one point in the sky, the ground antennas don't have to constantly track its position.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top:3%">When the STARnet is accessed, a request is sent from the device to the router which forwards it through the Davon antennas to the geostationary satellite. The satellite forwards the request to the ISP (Internet Service Provider) hub, which beams back the necessary data through the satellite. The technology constantly improves, reducing the inherent delay of the process as much as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>Davon's STARnet antennas uses both the Ka-band, and the Ku-band. This allow the microprocessors within the tiles to intelligently switch between the frequency range that suits your current activity the most. The Ka-band connectivity ensures high speeds when downloading files, streaming media and so on. The Ku-band is a reliable low-latency connection that is perfect for regular web pages, VOIP-services and rapid low-data transfering, such as chatting and more, and keeping you online when you want it the most: during extreme weather. This unique multi-band approach is unique to STARnet, ensuring a next-gen experience.

It shows the earth rotating at a speed of 1670 km/h, and the satellite doing twice that, so it always stays in the same spot in the sky, when seen from the earth. This illustration describes how the solar roof antennas only need to be calibrated once."/>

                    <h4>Internet Service Provider</h4>
                    <p>Davon is a fully independent ISP, offering its services globally. Davon doesn't have expensive or questionable ties with third parties, meaning your personal information is protected and safe. All data is encrypted by default and out of reach from local governments. Users anywhere in the world will be able to connect to the internet without the massive and harmful interference to the environment caused by digging down millions of miles of cables.
